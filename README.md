Generate C++ headers from DWARF Debugging Information Format (DWARF).

> \[!WARNING]
> This tool requires binaries that contain **DWARF debug information** in order to generate headers.
> Make sure your input binary includes DWARF debug info, which is often not publicly available in proprietary software.

## Installation

### Build from Source

Since dwarf2cpp uses **pybind11** to access LLVM's DWARF DebugInfo module from Python, you need a working C++ toolchain to build it:

* On Windows: **MSVC (Visual Studio Build Tools)**
* On Linux: **GCC (g++)**
* On macOS: **Apple Clang (Xcode Command Line Tools)**

```
git clone https://github.com/EndstoneMC/dwarf2cpp.git
cd dwarf2cpp
pip install .
```

After installation, run the tool with:

```
python -m dwarf2cpp
```

### Prebuilt Wheels

For convenience, **prebuilt wheels** are available from the GitHub Actions pages of this repository.
These wheels include the required C++ extension, so you do not need to have LLVM or a compiler toolchain installed
locally.

1. Visit the **Actions** tab on GitHub.
2. Select the latest successful build for your platform (Windows, Linux, or macOS).
3. Download the wheel artifact and install it with:

   ```
   pip install dwarf2cpp-<version>-<platform>.whl
   ```

This is the recommended option if you only want to use `dwarf2cpp` without setting up a compiler or LLVM.

## Usage

```
Usage: python -m dwarf2cpp [OPTIONS] PATH

Options:
  --base-dir TEXT         Base directory used during compilation.  [required]
  -o, --output-path PATH  Output directory for generated files. Defaults to
                          'out' inside the input file's directory.
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

The `PATH` argument must point to a binary containing DWARF debug information.

* `--base-dir` should point to the root directory used during compilation. This helps resolve relative include paths when reconstructing headers.
* `--output-path` controls where the generated headers are stored. If not specified, the tool creates an `out/` folder next to the input file.

## Examples

### Extract from `libminecraftpe.so`

```
python -m dwarf2cpp path/to/libminecraftpe.so --base-dir D:/a/_work/1/s
```

### Extract from `bedrock_server` (Linux)

```
python -m dwarf2cpp path/to/bedrock_server --base-dir /mnt/vss/_work/1/s
```

## Motivation / Purpose

Typical use cases include:

* Analysing the internals of proprietary software.
* Supporting the development of plugin frameworks such as **[Endstone](https://github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone)**.
* Research on automated source reconstruction from DWARF.

## Limitations

* Generated headers may not compile out-of-the-box. Manual adjustments may be required.
* Templates, inline functions, and macros cannot always be reconstructed accurately.
* Only works with binaries compiled with DWARF debug info. Stripped binaries will not work.
* Only trivially tested. It may fail with certain binaries.
